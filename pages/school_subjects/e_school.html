             Cladogram Program

          <p class="my_text_body">
              This project was something that came up in the classroom. In the explanation of cladograms, I realized,
              that it's very possible that no one has ever made a program to create a cladogram, so I went on a quest to
              rectify this.

          <p class="my_text_body">
              I expected this project to be an easy programming challenge, but it turned into two weeks of nonsense. It
              was only nonsensical, because I had to keep track of most of the variables throughout most of the code,
              which is something that I hadn't faced before. I ended up having to continuously explain what was going on
              in the code to myself, before I could write anything worthwhile.

            Monkey Physics
          </h3>
          <p class="my_text_body">
              This project was a classic take on the physics principle of the "Monkey Gun," where gravity affects
              everything "the same."
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxvsHNRXLjw">Here's a video on what it is.</a>

          <p class="my_text_body">
              In this project, I partnered with my friend Ryan, and we made our version of a "Monkey Gun."  Our launcher
              consisted of a pvc pipe, with rubber bands on one end.  This pipe launched a smaller pvc pipe, which would
              break a circuit that crossed the end of the pipe. This circuit, was holding the target up with an
              electromagnet. The circuit was our timing, because for the experiment to work, the target must fall at the
              same time the projectile is launched.
            </p>
          <p class="my_text_body">
              This project concluded with me programming an extremely simple representation of the physics involved.
              You can find this representation <a href="https://github.com/DieselPup999/school_monkey_physics">here.</a>
              With this project, I earned "Expert" in the learning target "Types of Forces," which is all about how
              various forces affect things, in this case it was how gravity affects both the target and projectile.
