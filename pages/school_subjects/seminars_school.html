            If you haven't read my About Me, then I should tell you that my school has a project based curriculum, but
            in addition to the project based nature of the school, we also have "seminars."  Seminars are like a
            traditional class, except they can be any reasonable length of time, and the outcome is earning learning
            targets, rather than a grade.

             Coursera Chemistry Seminar
          </h3>
          <p class="my_text_body">
              The Coursera Chemistry Seminar, was a Coursera course, that Mr. Bruss (our sciences teacher) found and
              utilized to teach us chemistry.
            </p>
          <!-- Can I make some kind of drop down bar here? so that this \/ text is hidden until you click "read more"-->
          <p class="my_text_body">
              The Chemistry Seminar lasted about 2 months. These 2 months consisted of working on the Coursera course
              and meeting every other day for about an hour and a half, mostly to discuss what we had learned by
              ourselves since the last time we met, or to take the final tests to show our learning.
              </p>
          <p class="my_text_body">
              From this seminar, I earned "Proficient" in several learning targets.
            </p>
          <ul>
              <li>"Waves and Electromagnetic Radiation" - all about waves</li>
              <li>"Atomic Structure" - all about how atoms make up elements</li>
              <li>"Physical Properties and Changes of Matter" - all about the attributes of matter</li>
              <li>"The Periodic Table" - all about how elements are related to each other and how to read and use the
                  periodic table</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>
            Communism Seminar
          </h3>
          <p class="my_text_body">
              The Communism Seminar, was a seminar that a friend of mine put together.  He worked out a leadership
              project with his advisor and as a result got to host a seminar about political structures. This
              seminar lasted about a month or two.
            </p>
          <!-- Can I make some kind of drop down bar here? so that this \/ text is hidden until you click "read more"-->
          <p class="my_text_body">
              During this seminar we would meet every other day for about an hour and a half, for a lecture of sorts,
              an activity, or an conversation about what it's like to live in the different political systems.  The
              activities were mostly representations of the different political systems, and the conversations almost
              turned into mini-debates.
            </p>
          <p class="my_text_body">
              At the end of this seminar, to show our learning, we had a debate.  The debate was about which political
              system (Capitalism, Socialism, or Communism) was the best one for a country. The debate was friendly and
              had no specified winners nor losers, but it was great fun, and speech practice. With this seminar I earned
              "Proficent" in several learning targets.
            </p>
          <ul>
              <li>"Political Organization" - all about the different political systems</li>
              <li>"Political Systems" - how different political systems define and protect an individual's rights</li>
              <li>"Theories of Governmental Power" - analyzing how governmental powers might be used to promote or
                  hinder liberty, equality, and justice</li>
              <li>"Types of Economies" - how different economic systems have been used in the past</li>
